Certainly, you can use the concept of the slope of the lines formed by the sides of the isosceles trapezoid to determine if two points fall within it. Here's a formulaic approach to verify if two points are within the specified isosceles trapezoid:

Let's assume the isosceles trapezoid has two equal sides of length \(a\) and the other two sides are \(b\) and \(c\), with \(b < c\). The points you want to validate are \(P(x_1, y_1)\) and \(Q(x_2, y_2)\), and the distance between them is \(d\).

1. Calculate the slope \(m\) of the line connecting the two points:
   
   \[m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\]

2. Calculate the slopes \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) of the trapezoid's non-parallel sides (slopes of the sides with lengths \(b\) and \(c\)).

   For the side with length \(b\):
   \[m_1 = \frac{c - a}{d}\]

   For the side with length \(c\):
   \[m_2 = \frac{a - b}{d}\]

3. Check if the slope of the line connecting the points (\(m\)) falls within the range defined by \(m_1\) and \(m_2\). If \(m_1 \leq m \leq m_2\), then the points \(P\) and \(Q\) lie within the trapezoid.

In mathematical terms:
\[m_1 \leq m \leq m_2\]

This formulaic approach helps determine if the line formed by the points falls within the range of slopes created by the trapezoid's non-parallel sides. If the condition is met, the points are located within the isosceles trapezoid; otherwise, they lie outside its boundaries.

Keep in mind that this approach assumes that the points are aligned vertically along the y-axis and that the trapezoid's sides are parallel to the x-axis. If the orientation is different, further adjustments to the formula may be necessary.
