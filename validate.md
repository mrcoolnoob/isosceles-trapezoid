Certainly, you can use the concept of the slope of the lines formed by the sides of the isosceles trapezoid to determine if two points fall within it. Here's a formulaic approach to verify if two points are within the specified isosceles trapezoid:

Let's assume the isosceles trapezoid has two equal sides of length \(a\) and the other two sides are \(b\) and \(c\), with \(b < c\). The points you want to validate are \(P(x_1, y_1)\) and \(Q(x_2, y_2)\), and the distance between them is \(d\).

1. Calculate the slope \(m\) of the line connecting the two points:
   
   \[m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\]

2. Calculate the slopes \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) of the trapezoid's non-parallel sides (slopes of the sides with lengths \(b\) and \(c\)).

   For the side with length \(b\):
   \[m_1 = \frac{c - a}{d}\]

   For the side with length \(c\):
   \[m_2 = \frac{a - b}{d}\]

3. Check if the slope of the line connecting the points (\(m\)) falls within the range defined by \(m_1\) and \(m_2\). If \(m_1 \leq m \leq m_2\), then the points \(P\) and \(Q\) lie within the trapezoid.

In mathematical terms:
\[m_1 \leq m \leq m_2\]

This formulaic approach helps determine if the line formed by the points falls within the range of slopes created by the trapezoid's non-parallel sides. If the condition is met, the points are located within the isosceles trapezoid; otherwise, they lie outside its boundaries.

Keep in mind that this approach assumes that the points are aligned vertically along the y-axis and that the trapezoid's sides are parallel to the x-axis. If the orientation is different, further adjustments to the formula may be necessary.

## C Implementation

```
using System;

class IsoscelesTrapezoidValidation
{
    // Define the trapezoid's vertices
    static double x1 = /* Vertex A's x-coordinate */;
    static double y1 = /* Vertex A's y-coordinate */;
    static double x2 = /* Vertex B's x-coordinate */;
    static double y2 = /* Vertex B's y-coordinate */;
    static double x3 = /* Vertex C's x-coordinate */;
    static double y3 = /* Vertex C's y-coordinate */;
    static double x4 = /* Vertex D's x-coordinate */;
    static double y4 = /* Vertex D's y-coordinate */;

    // Check if a point (x, y) is within the trapezoid
    static bool IsPointWithinTrapezoid(double x, double y)
    {
        bool horizontalCheck = false;
        bool verticalCheck = false;

        // Calculate slopes and y-intercepts of the trapezoid's sides
        double mAB = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1);
        double bAB = y1 - mAB * x1;

        double mCD = (y4 - y3) / (x4 - x3);
        double bCD = y3 - mCD * x3;

        // Check if the point passes the horizontal test
        if (y >= mAB * x + bAB && y >= mCD * x + bCD)
        {
            horizontalCheck = true;

            // Check if the point passes the vertical test
            if (y <= y1 && y >= y4)
            {
                verticalCheck = true;
            }
        }

        return horizontalCheck && verticalCheck;
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        double pointX = /* Your point's x-coordinate */;
        double pointY = /* Your point's y-coordinate */;

        bool isWithinTrapezoid = IsPointWithinTrapezoid(pointX, pointY);

        if (isWithinTrapezoid)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("The point is within the trapezoid.");
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("The point is outside the trapezoid.");
        }
    }
}
